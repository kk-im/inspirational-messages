# hackathon-2021

A project created for the SheSharp Hackathon 2021(https://www.shesharp.co/2021-hackathon/)

**Project requirements**

A successful project should:

- Generate supportive and/or inspirational messages (e.g. "You've got this!" or "All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.") Please note that all messages should follow our Hackathon Code of Conduct.
- Display messages either on-demand (e.g. via button click, Twitter reply) or at timed intervals (e.g. daily reminder bot)

**My take**

They say
    a picture is worth a thousand words...
I say
  the picture is worth a thousand more if: (1) It if a meme, and (2) if it makes you chuckle.
  
I created a nifty giph(t)y web app that generates a random gif when you click a button.

**Tech**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JS
- API Integration (GIPHY)
